All walkthroughs are in encrypted PDFs.  The password is the flag to that particular challenge.

## Challenges
- [Lernaean](Lernaean.pdf) - Your target is not very good with computers. Try and guess their password to see if they may be hiding anything!
- [Cartographer](Cartographer.pdf) - Some underground hackers are developing a new command and control server. Can you break in and see what they are up to?
- [HDC](HDC.pdf) - We believe a certain individual uses this website for shady business. Can you find out who that is and send him an email to check, using the web site's functionality?
- [I know Mag1k](I_Know_Mag1k.pdf) - Can you get to the profile page of the admin?
- Grammar - When we access this page we get a Forbidden error. However we believe that something strange lies behind... Can you find a way in and retrieve the flag?
