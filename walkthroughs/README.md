# Walkthroughs
Capture the flag repository -- walkthroughs, notes, tools, references, etc...

## Walkthroughs
All walkthroughs are in encrypted PDFs.  The password is the flag to that particular challenge.  When working through challenges I sometimes enjoy a hint, possibly a tool or vulnerability that I have never encountered.  But I do not like when too much is given.  I want to learn, I want to succeed, but I do not want the answer just given to me.  I also enjoy reading other people's walkthroughs after I complete a challenge to see different approaches or different toolsets.  So that is what I have here, how I solved the challenges.  If you are looking for a hint, [let me know](https://www.twitter.com/pwlk) and we can talk.
